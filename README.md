1. On the application homepage, you will see a Google login button. <br/>
2. Click the Google login button to initiate the OAuth authentication flow.<br/>
3. A Google login window will appear. Sign in with your Google credentials.<br/>
4. Upon successful login, you will be redirected back to the application, and your authentication token will be stored.<br/>
5. After logging in, the feedback form will be displayed.<br/>
6. Select a feedback category from the dropdown menu (e.g., Product Features, Product Pricing, Product Usability).<br/>

8. Provide any comments you have about the product.<br/>
9. Click the submit button to send your feedback.<br/>
10. Upon submission, the feedback data (category, rating, and comments) will be sent to the backend server.<br/>
11. The backend server will store the feedback in your local database (MongoDB).<br/>
